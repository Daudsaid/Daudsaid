👋 Hi, I’m Daud Abdi (@Daudsaid)

I’m a Golang Backend Developer with a frontend development background, passionate about building fast, secure, and scalable applications. I specialize in Go (Golang), PostgreSQL/MySQL, and REST/gRPC APIs — particularly for industries like fintech, e-commerce, and digital platforms.

With a strong foundation in frontend technologies like React and Tailwind CSS, I also enjoy building full‑stack projects, APIs, and tools that deliver real business value.

⸻

💡 What I Do
	•	⚙️ Backend Development (Go) – Build high‑performance REST and gRPC APIs, integrate with databases, and handle concurrency using goroutines and channels.
	•	🗄️ Databases – Design, query, and optimize relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) for backend systems.
	•	🛠 API Development & Integration – Secure API endpoints, authentication, and 3rd‑party service integrations.
	•	📈 Scalable Architectures – Write clean, maintainable code for microservices and distributed systems.
	•	⚛️ Frontend Dev (React + Tailwind CSS) – Create responsive interfaces for backend‑driven apps.
